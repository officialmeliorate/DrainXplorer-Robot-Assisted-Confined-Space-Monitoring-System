The DrainXplorer is an innovative robot-assisted monitoring system designed for confined spaces, particularly in drainage and sewer environments. 

Its primary functions include real-time monitoring,equipped with advanced sensors and cameras. It provides real-time video feeds and environmental data, allowing operators to assess conditions without entering hazardous areas.

The system is designed to enhance safety by minimizing human exposure to dangerous environments.

The DrainXplorer collects valuable data like temperature, humidity level, presence of harmful gases like LPG, smoke, alcohol, propane, hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide and the presence of fire also for analysis, which can help in maintenance planning, identifying blockages, and assessing the overall health of drainage systems.
